## ‚ú® Core Features

StorIA-LITE provides a robust set of features to cover all essential inventory management needs:

- **Item Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your inventory items. Track SKUs, categories, descriptions, quantities, and even expiration dates.
- **Movement Tracking**: Log all stock movements, whether it's an entry (receiving goods) or an exit (shipping or internal use). Every movement is recorded against a user and an item, providing a full audit trail.
- **User Management**: Secure user registration and authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Authentication**: Modern JWT-based authentication to secure your API endpoints.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: A comprehensive dashboard that provides an at-a-glance overview of key inventory metrics, such as total items, stock levels, and recent movements.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on inventory status, movement history, and more, allowing for data-driven decision-making.
- **Search and Pagination**: Efficiently search and navigate through large sets of items and movements.

## üí° Project Philosophy

The development of StorIA-LITE is guided by a few core principles:

1.  **Clean Architecture**: We strictly follow the principles of Clean Architecture. This means a clear separation of concerns between the Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers. This makes the system more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
2.  **Open Source**: We believe in the power of community. StorIA-LITE is fully open-source under the Apache-2.0 license, and we welcome contributions from developers everywhere.
3.  **Modern & Reliable Technology**: The system is built on top of .NET 8, a long-term support (LTS) release, ensuring stability and access to the latest C# features. We use proven technologies like PostgreSQL for the database and React for the frontend.
4.  **Extensibility**: Although this is a "LITE" version, it's built with extensibility in mind. The decoupled nature of the architecture makes it easy to add new features or integrate with other systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for the Web Client)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) Server
-   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vytruve/storia-lite.git
    cd storia-lite
    ```

2.  **Setup the Database:**
    -   Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    -   Create a new database, for example, `storia_lite_db`.
    -   You can use a tool like `pgAdmin` or the `psql` command line.

3.  **Configure the Backend:**
    -   Navigate to the API project directory: `cd src/System/API`
    -   Rename `appsettings.Development.template.json` to `appsettings.Development.json`.
    -   Open `appsettings.Development.json` and update the `DefaultConnection` string with your PostgreSQL credentials.
        ```json
        "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=storia_lite_db;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
        },
        "JwtSettings": {
          "Secret": "A_VERY_LONG_AND_SECURE_SECRET_KEY_CHANGE_ME",
          "Issuer": "StorIA-LITE",
          "Audience": "StorIA-LITE-Users"
        }
        ```
    -   **Important**: Change the `JwtSettings:Secret` to a long, random, and secret string.

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    -   Navigate to the web client directory: `cd ../../WebClient`
    -   Install the required npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### Running the Backend API

1.  Navigate to the API project directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/System/API
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
3.  The API will be running at `https://localhost:7123` (or a similar port). You can access the Swagger UI at `https://localhost:7123/swagger` to explore and test the endpoints.

### Running the Web Client

1.  Navigate to the web client directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/WebClient
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  The React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port).

---

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

The solution includes projects for unit and integration tests (currently under development). To run the tests, navigate to the solution root (`src/System`) and run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

---

##  swagger API Documentation

Once the backend API is running, you can access the interactive Swagger documentation in your browser. This UI provides a complete list of all available endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses. You can even test the endpoints directly from the browser.

**Swagger UI URL**: `https://localhost:7123/swagger`

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

The repository includes Kubernetes deployment files (`.yaml`) in the `src/System/Deploy` directory. These can be used as a template for deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

A `Dockerfile` is also provided in `src/System` to containerize the backend API.
