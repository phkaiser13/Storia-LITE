## ‚ú® Features

The Web Client provides a comprehensive interface for all essential inventory management tasks:

  - **Dashboard Analytics**: An intuitive dashboard gives you an at-a-glance overview of key inventory metrics.
  - **Item Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your inventory items.
  - **Movement Tracking**: Log all stock movements, such as entries (check-ins) and exits (check-outs).
  - **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration powered by JWT.
  - **Role-Based Access Control**: The UI dynamically adapts to the user's role (`Almoxarife`, `RH`, `Colaborador`), showing only the features they are permitted to access.
  - **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on inventory status, such as items nearing their expiration date.
  - **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern interface that works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

-----

## üíª Technology Stack

The web client is built with a modern and powerful set of technologies:

  - **Framework**: React (v19)
  - **Build Tool**: Vite
  - **Language**: TypeScript
  - **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state, and React Context for global UI state.
  - **Routing**: React Router (v7)
  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach.
  - **HTTP Client**: Axios for making requests to the backend API.
  - **Form Management**: React Hook Form for efficient and scalable forms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the web client up and running for development.

### Prerequisites

  - [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher recommended)
  - The [StorIA-LITE Backend API](https://www.google.com/search?q=../System/README.md) must be running, as this client depends on it for data.

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the WebClient directory:**
    From the root of the repository, run:

    ```bash
    cd src/WebClient
    ```

2.  **Install the required npm packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

-----

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server.

1.  **Start the Vite development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Open the application in your browser:**
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The console output will show the exact address.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The Web Client's source code is organized to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

  - `src/components`: Reusable React components used across multiple pages (e.g., `Modal`, `Sidebar`, `StatCard`).
  - `src/contexts`: React Context providers for managing global state, such as authentication (`AuthContext.tsx`).
  - `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic (e.g., `useAuth.ts`).
  - `src/pages`: Top-level components that represent the different pages of the application (e.g., `DashboardPage.tsx`, `ItemsPage.tsx`).
  - `src/services`: Modules responsible for external communication, primarily the `api.ts` file which configures the Axios instance for interacting with the backend.
  - `src/types`: Contains all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for the application.

-----

## üîó Connecting to the API

  - All API communication is handled by the configured Axios instance in `src/services/api.ts`.
  - The base URL is set to `https://localhost:7200`, which is the default for the backend API. If your backend is running on a different address, you will need to update this file.
  - The service includes interceptors to automatically attach the JWT `Authorization` header to requests and to handle token refresh logic for a seamless user experience.
