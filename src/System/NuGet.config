 * Description:
 *   This file configures the NuGet package sources for the .NET project.
 *   The <clear /> directive is used to remove all previously defined package 
 *   sources (e.g., from user-level or machine-level configs). This ensures a 
 *   clean and predictable build environment by explicitly defining nuget.org 
 *   as the one and only trusted source for packages. This is a security and 
 *   reproducibility best practice.
